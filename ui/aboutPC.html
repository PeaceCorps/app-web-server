            <h3>What is Peace Corps</h3>
            <p>
                The Peace Corps is a service opportunity for motivated change makers to engage themselves in a community abroad, working side by side with local leaders to tackle the most pressing challenges of our generation. Former president of the United States of America John F. Kennedy formed peace corps in the 1st of March 1961 
                which is an independent agency within the executive branch of the United States government.

            <h3>How Peace Corps fulfill their goals</h3>
            <p>
                Peace corps has launched many services in order to fulfill their three goals. Some of their services are described below.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li><h4>Let Girls Learn</h4>
                    <p>
                        Educating girls is essential to healthy and thriving communities but, globally, 62 million girls are not in school, and barriers to adolescent girls completing school are particularly significant.
                        Since the launch of Let Girls Learn, Peace Corps Volunteers around the world have responded to the call to make a difference in their communities of service.   
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><h4>President's Malaria Initiative</h4>
                    <p>Peace Corps Volunteers are advancing President's Malaria Initiative through the agency's Stomping Out Malaria in Africa initiative. Volunteers in 22 Peace Corps programs across Africa are collaborating to eradicate malaria by carrying out malaria prevention, diagnosis, and treatment education campaigns at the community level.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h4>Global Food Security & Feed the Future</h4>
                    <p>In partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development, Peace Corps Volunteers are supporting the President's Feed the Future initiative by promoting sustainable methods for local people to assure their own food security through increased agricultural productivity, improved economic opportunity, and improved health and nutrition.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h4>President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</h4>
                    <p>Through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Peace Corps Volunteers continue to implement PEPFAR's Blueprint to an AIDS-free generation through the targeted goals of scaling up prevention and treatment; implementing evidence-based interventions for populations at greatest risk; promoting sustainability, efficiency, and effectiveness; strengthening local health care and support systems; and driving results with science. </p>
